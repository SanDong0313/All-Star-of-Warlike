# All-Star-of-Warlike
Hi. Every one. I'm Unity3D game developer so I 'm crazy about this.
This demo project is developed for 10 days on case that all assets are supported.
In this game , the best thing is UI. So I designed UI for 4 days and UI can be used for VR or AR.
When start game , player can feel that user is on space.
So this is only demo , I have to add many functions and others.

# How can you test this?
You can download app and run it on your smart phone.


# Intro about step
Let me introduce about All Star of Warlike

This game is about heroes that are fighting to found their kingdom. The story is similar as Three Kingdoms but not exactly same as it. In this game demo , there are 53 heroes that you can play and 30 type of enemies.
I'm going to make this game as NFT and gonna add almost game modes such as strategy , fighting , battle , puzzle , adventure , historic , tournament and so on.
And I'm going to this game as MMORPG , TDM using photon SDK that helps for unity online multiplayer strongly.
